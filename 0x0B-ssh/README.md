Do not mix up server and web server.



### Web Server



A Web Server is a software that delivers web pages. A Server is an actual computer. But you might hear people referring to a Web Server using the word Server.



As mentioned above, a server is a physical machine, an actual computer, but in the Cloud era that could also be a virtual computer generally, call VM ([Virtual Machine](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/mJd0UJIoeAOcVg9P7YTvYg)) or [container](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/IwFxKnTQzDr-Rv7GIZ8mLg).

- How to create an SSH RSA key pair

- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair



### Requirements



- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

- All your files should end with a new line

- All your Bash script files must be executable

- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash

- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

- The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash for instance is that it will make your script portable for different OS where Bash might be in a different location.
